- 👋 Hi, I’m @DarkPhantomZee
- 👀 I’m interested in Cyber Security and Augmented Reality, and hope that this platform enables me to not just document all my works and findings, but to also harness my skillset and to apply them in the real world.  

- 🌱 I’m currently learning to build a Linux OS (for personal use). If anyone has any details or references they would like to share, that would be awesome.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Augmented Reality.
- 📫 How to reach me - send me a dm on Discord at @DarkPhantomZee#7447 with the subject name Github:(Subject Name Here)
